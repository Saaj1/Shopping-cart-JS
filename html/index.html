        <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
        <p>“ Before joining Melsoft Academy, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of experience. It certainly will help me land a job as a full-stack 100% recommend! ”</p>
